Version 3.10
* Fixed the link in the header of the configuration file not working correctly.
* Added multiworld support for each stream category.
** Example: If a player joins a world where stream is allowed, the join message will be allowed to display.
** Stream from all worlds are by default controlled by HideStream, meaning that no world is exempt from stream messages by default.
** To exempt worlds from stream, remove them from the "x.AffectedWorlds" list in the configuration file.
* Removed the setting "StreamEnabledByDefault" under PerPlayerToggle category in the configuration file.
** This function never really served a good purpose.
** All stream settings, except for "x.AffectedWorlds", will now be ignored if PerPlayerToggle is enabled. This basically works just like it always has.
* Improved some output responses.
* Updater will now only run the check once every 24th hour instead of every 3rd.

Version 3.9
* Updated to officially support Minecraft // Spigot // Bukkit 1.14.4
* Added a new command which allows you to change/configure the amount of players that has to be online in order for stream messages to  be hidden(affected to HideStream) in-game. 
** /hs onlineamount <amountOfPlayers> [join/quit/kick/death]
** Permission: hidestream.command.onlineamount
** You do not necessarily need to specify a category, if none is typed HideStream will make the change globally across all categories. Updated the auto-updater library(BukkitDev).

Version 3.6
* Fixed a problem with permissions handling.
* There has been a major change to how kick and quit messages are processed by HideStream.
** The two features will now be completely compatible with eachother.
** This fixes a bug where if you, for an example only wanted kick messages to show in the chat, it would not work as the quit management is handled after kick management. In other words, the quit management had higher priority than kick management.
** Thanks to becja2010 for pointing out this error.
* There has been some minor changes to the configuration file to clear up some confusion.
* Fixed some graphical issues with the command help page.

* Changed the default permission message in the config.
* Dropped OPSupport as the permissions system defaults to OP, which makes OPSupport useless.
* The configuration has been slightly changed and optimized. Any changes will convert automatically.
* Added two new settings for each stream category except Death.
** 'xx.OnlyForNewPlayers', if enabled, the stream handling will only be activated for new players.
